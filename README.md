# foam

> Foam is a Twitch mobile app that supports emotes, badges and user colors from [7TV](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/7tv/ammjkodgmmoknidbanneddgankgfejfh), [BetterTTV (BTTV)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betterttv/ajopnjidmegmdimjlfnijceegpefgped), and [FrankerFaceZ (FFZ)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frankerfacez/fadndhdgpmmaapbmfcknlfgcflmmmieb) â€” third-party extensions for Twitch used by millions to aid in making the mobile chat experience more enjoyable.

<br />

This repository is managed currently using yarn v3. We're in the process of migrating to PNPM + PNPM workspaces and a monorepo structure

## Why Foam?

The native twitch mobile app does not support emotes, badges and user colors from the above third-party extensions, resulting in only emote text names to be rendered rather than their actual image or GIF, resulting in a poor mobile chat experience.

In addition to this, Foam supports many actions to meet feature parity with the native Twitch mobile app, such as participating in polls, redeeming channel points (with a few extra sprinkles such as auto-redeeming points ðŸ˜‰) and refreshing chat when new emote are added to a channel.
