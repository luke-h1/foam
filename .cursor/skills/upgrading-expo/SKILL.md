## Step-by-Step Upgrade Process

1. Upgrade Expo and dependencies

```bash
npx expo install expo@latest
npx expo install --fix
```

2. Run diagnostics: `npx expo-doctor`

3. Clear caches and reinstall

```bash
npx expo export -p ios --clear
rm -rf node_modules .expo
watchman watch-del-all
```

## Breaking Changes Checklist

- Check for removed APIs in release notes
- Update import paths for moved modules
- Review native module changes requiring prebuild
- Test all camera, audio, and video features
- Verify navigation still works correctly

## Prebuild for Native Changes

If upgrading requires native changes:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

This regenerates the `ios` and `android` directories. Ensure the project is not a bare workflow app before running this command.

## Clear caches for bare workflow

- Clear the cocoapods cache for iOS: `cd ios && pod install --repo-update`
- Clear derived data for Xcode: `npx expo run:ios --no-build-cache`
- Clear the Gradle cache for Android: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`

## Housekeeping

- Review release notes for the target SDK version at https://expo.dev/changelog
- If using Expo SDK 54 or later, ensure react-native-worklets is installed — this is required for react-native-reanimated to work.
- Enable React Compiler in SDK 54+ by adding `"experiments": { "reactCompiler": true }` to app.json — it's stable and recommended
- Delete sdkVersion from `app.json` to let Expo manage it automatically
- Remove implicit packages from `package.json`: `@babel/core`, `babel-preset-expo`, `expo-constants`.
- If the babel.config.js only contains 'babel-preset-expo', delete the file
- If the metro.config.js only contains expo defaults, delete the file

## Removing patches

Check if there are any outdated patches in the `patches/` directory. Remove them if they are no longer needed.

## Postcss

- `autoprefixer` isn't needed in SDK +53.
- Use `postcss.config.mjs` in SDK +53.

## Metro

Remove redundant metro config options:

- resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports is enabled by default in SDK +53.
- `experimentalImportSupport` is enabled by default in SDK +54.
- `EXPO_USE_FAST_RESOLVER=1` is removed in SDK +54.
- cjs and mjs extensions are supported by default in SDK +50.
- Expo webpack is deprecated, migrate to [Expo Router and Metro web](https://docs.expo.dev/router/migrate/from-expo-webpack/).

## New Architecture

The new architecture is enabled by default, the app.json field `"newArchEnabled": true` is no longer needed as it's the default. Expo Go only supports the new architecture as of SDK +53.
