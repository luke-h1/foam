# Dogfood

Router for exploratory QA. Private setup before using this skill:

```bash
agent-device --version
```

Require `agent-device >= 0.14.0`; older CLIs lack these help topics. If older, run `npm install -g agent-device@latest`, recheck, then continue. If you cannot upgrade, stop and tell the user. Do not include version/upgrade commands in final plans.

Read current CLI guidance:

```bash
agent-device help dogfood
```

Loop: open named session -> snapshot -i + screenshot -> explore flows -> capture evidence per issue -> close.

Target app is required; infer platform or ask. Findings must come from runtime behavior, not source reads. Let `help dogfood` provide exact report shape, evidence commands, and current workflow guidance.
