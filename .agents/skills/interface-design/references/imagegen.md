# Codex Image Generation Workflow

Use this reference only when running in Codex and `$imagegen` or native image generation is available. In other agents, keep the same design reasoning but skip image generation.

Image generation is a visual companion for interface design. It is not the final UI source of truth. Generate images to explore direction, sharpen critique, or create project-bound raster assets; then translate the useful decisions into tokens, layout, components, states, and code.

## When to Use Image Generation

Use `$imagegen` when one of these is true:

- The project has no `.interface-design/system.md` and visual direction is still open.
- The user asks for a new screen, dashboard, app shell, design direction, redesign, polish pass, or "make it beautiful" work.
- The interface needs a distinctive product-specific signature and the text exploration is still too abstract.
- A screenshot exists and the next step is a craft critique or stronger visual alternative.
- The UI needs a project-bound raster asset: empty-state illustration, textured background, product placeholder, banner, onboarding image, or domain-specific visual.

Skip image generation when:

- The task is a small component tweak with an established system.
- The existing product design is locked and the requested change is implementation-only.
- The needed output is a precise icon, logo, SVG, chart, diagram, or UI text layout better handled in code.
- Generated visuals would slow the work without clarifying a decision.

## Core Loop

1. Explore domain, color world, signature, and defaults as usual.
2. Decide whether an image will clarify the next decision.
3. Use `$imagegen` for one of four modes: direction board, UI reference, screenshot paintover, or raster asset.
4. Inspect the image. Reject generic SaaS, decorative noise, unreadable UI, impossible layouts, bad text, and off-domain palettes.
5. Extract decisions from the useful parts: palette, density, proportions, surface strategy, navigation model, signature element, and asset style.
6. Implement in code. Do not treat the generated image as the implementation.
7. Verify the real UI in a browser or screenshot.
8. Save durable decisions to `.interface-design/system.md` when they should persist.

## Mode 1: Direction Boards

Use before code when the product direction is open. Generate 2-3 visually distinct boards, not full UI screens.

Each board should show:

- Product world and material cues
- Color temperature and accent behavior
- Surface/depth mood
- Density and rhythm
- One possible signature element

Avoid:

- Generic dashboard cards
- Legible UI text
- Final product screens
- Decorative gradients and abstract blobs

Prompt scaffold:

```text
Use case: ui-mockup
Asset type: interface design direction board, not a final UI
Primary request: Explore a visual direction for [product/domain].
Audience/task: [human] needs to [core verb].
Feel: [specific emotional/operational quality].
Domain cues: [5+ concepts from exploration].
Color world: [5+ physical/domain colors].
Signature idea: [unique visual/structural/interaction concept].
Composition: moodboard-like composition with interface fragments, material samples, layout rhythm, surface hierarchy, and abstracted controls.
Text: no readable product copy; use abstract blocks and tiny illegible labels only.
Avoid: generic SaaS dashboard, blue-purple gradients, floating cards everywhere, decorative blobs, stock-photo feel, unreadable contrast.
```

After generation, choose the useful direction by naming:

- Palette primitives
- Surface/depth strategy
- Navigation or composition model
- Signature element
- Defaults it replaces

## Mode 2: UI Reference Mockups

Use for greenfield screens and major redesigns after direction is chosen. Generate a medium-fidelity reference image to make composition concrete, then implement it in code.

The generated mockup may inspire:

- Layout proportions
- Information hierarchy
- Component density
- Surface stacking
- Motion/interaction hints
- Signature element placement

Do not rely on generated text, exact measurements, chart values, icons, or data correctness.

Prompt scaffold:

```text
Use case: ui-mockup
Asset type: medium-fidelity product interface reference
Primary request: Create a reference mockup for [screen/workflow].
Audience/task: [human] needs to [core verb].
Chosen direction: [direction board summary].
Layout requirements: [navigation, panels, table/chart/form, primary action].
Signature element: [specific recurring product-only element].
Design system: [depth strategy, spacing base, radius, typography mood, palette primitives].
Text: use mostly abstract labels or very short generic labels; do not depend on exact readable text.
Responsive intent: design should translate cleanly to desktop and mobile.
Avoid: generic dashboard template, impossible controls, noisy decoration, too many accent colors, illegible contrast.
```

When coding from a mockup:

- Translate the image into real component structure.
- Replace image text with real product copy.
- Use stable responsive constraints, not pixel-copying.
- Verify with browser screenshots.

## Mode 3: Screenshot Paintovers

Use after implementation when the UI works but lacks craft. Capture or inspect the current screen first, then use it as a reference for a stronger design direction.

Ask `$imagegen` for a better version that preserves:

- Product purpose
- Main layout and workflow
- Required data regions
- Existing brand/system constraints if present

Ask it to improve:

- Focal hierarchy
- Rhythm and proportions
- Surface layering
- Density
- Signature visibility
- Empty/error/loading state presence

Prompt scaffold:

```text
Use case: ui-mockup
Asset type: design critique paintover reference
Primary request: Create a more crafted version of this product UI while preserving the workflow and required information.
Preserve: [layout/workflow/data constraints].
Improve: hierarchy, proportions, surface depth, density rhythm, signature element, and visual specificity.
System constraints: [tokens, palette, typography, depth strategy, component library].
Text: do not introduce new exact product copy; keep labels abstract unless provided.
Avoid: changing the product category, adding decorative art, inventing unsupported features, generic SaaS styling.
```

Then compare the real screenshot to the generated reference. Patch only the decisions that make the real UI better and remain feasible in the codebase.

## Mode 4: Project-Bound Raster Assets

Use for assets that should ship or be referenced by the UI:

- Empty-state illustration
- Onboarding or setup image
- Domain-specific placeholder
- Background texture or material
- Product mockup or feature preview

Do not use raster generation for:

- Icons when the repo uses an icon set
- Logos/brand marks that need vector precision
- Charts or diagrams that need data accuracy
- UI text that must be legible and exact

After generation:

1. Inspect the result.
2. Move or copy the selected asset into the project.
3. Use a stable, descriptive filename.
4. Update code references.
5. Verify the asset renders at desktop and mobile sizes.
6. Record the final prompt and path if the asset defines reusable visual language.

## Saving Visual Decisions

When image generation shapes the design, offer to save the durable parts to `.interface-design/system.md`.

Suggested format:

```markdown
## Visual Direction
Source: Codex image generation
Selected reference: path/to/reference.png
Prompt summary: [one paragraph]
Palette: [primitive colors and why]
Surface strategy: [borders-only/subtle shadows/layered/surface shifts]
Signature: [element and where it appears]
Do not use: [rejected defaults and visual traps]
```

Save image references only when they will help future sessions. Do not save discarded variants, one-off assets, or prompts that did not influence the final UI.

## Quality Gate

Before showing the result, confirm:

- The real UI, not the generated image, is the deliverable.
- Generated direction appears in at least five concrete places if it was used.
- Tokens and component choices match the selected visual direction.
- Text is real, readable, and implemented in code.
- Layout works in browser screenshots at relevant breakpoints.
- Project-bound generated assets live in the workspace, not only in Codex's default generated image location.
